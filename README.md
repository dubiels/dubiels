### Hi there 👋
I'm Karolina *(care-uh-lee-nuh)*, a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech with concentrations in Cybersecurity and People (Human-Centered Computing). <br>
I enjoy working in Java, Python, and HTML/CSS/JS, but I love learning new languages/stacks. 💌

More details about my projects can be found on my website, [karolina.mgdubiel.com](https://karolina.mgdubiel.com). 🚀✨
