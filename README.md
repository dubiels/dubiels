### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Karolina *(care-uh-LEE-nuh)*, a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech with concentrations in Cybersecurity and People (Human-Centered Computing). <br>
I most ofen build with Java, Python, and HTML/CSS/JS, but I also love learning new languages/stacks. ðŸ’Œ

More details about my projects can be found on my website, [karolina.mgdubiel.com](https://karolina.mgdubiel.com). ðŸš€âœ¨

I love going to large hackathons; so far, I've been to:
- ImpactHack @ GT '23
- Hack the North @ UWaterloo '24
- TreeHacks @ Stanford '25
