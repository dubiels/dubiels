### Hi there 👋
I'm Karolina *(care-uh-LEE-nuh)*, a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech with concentrations in Cybersecurity and People (Human-Centered Computing). <br>
I most ofen build with Python, Java, and HTML/CSS/JS (fullstack web dev), but I also love learning new languages/stacks. 💌

More details about my projects can be found on my website, [karolina.mgdubiel.com](https://karolina.mgdubiel.com). 🚀✨

I love going to large hackathons; so far, I've been to:
- ImpactHack @ Georgia Tech '23
- Hack the North @ UWaterloo '24
- TreeHacks @ Stanford '25
- HackUPC @ Barcelona Tech '25
